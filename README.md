This project is an assignment for my FED module, where I am tasked to build a functioning website from scratch. In this project, I had to search up for much inspiration and re-visit many lessons of the coding languages taught in my previous lessons.

This website is essentially a website that sells clothing apparels to women, from teenagers to middle aged women. It is a website that is easy to navigate and explore, which makes the shopping experience all the more relaxing.

Design Process
During the design process, I came across many issues like the website being unaesthetically pleasing and a little bit tiring to look at. To combat this, I looked up to colours that female audiences would naturally gravitate to and feel calm looking at. The layout is kept simplistic/minimalist to help with user experience.
